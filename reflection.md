This course has so far been my most challenging course yet.  While some parts of the course came somewhat naturally or were easy to grasp there was definetly times where I was completely lost.  For this final project in particular it was difficult to stay focused to all the moving parts.  With so many folders working together when I added code I had to make sure all the import files were matching and such. Integrating Minio was pretty difficult and I am still not sure if it was done properly but I am sure that the organization is atleast there.  My attempts were mostly debugging typos and errors such as "502 Bad Gateway" which seemed to be the problem over my shoulder the majority of the time.  I would say the project was rewarding in the sense that I used the interent and videos and even previous assignments to try and understand what I was doing wrong and how to make it right.  This project along with the course has been my greatest challenge but I think I can still say I did give it my best effort and used as many resources as I could.
