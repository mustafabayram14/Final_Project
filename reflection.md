This course has so far been my most challenging course yet.  While some parts of the course came somewhat naturally or were easy to grasp there was definetly times where I was completely lost.  For this final project in particular it was difficult to stay focused to all the moving parts.  With so many folders working together when I added code I had to make sure all the import files were matching and such. Integrating Minio was pretty difficult and I am still not sure if it was done properly but I am sure that the organization is atleast there.  My attempts were mostly debugging typos and errors such as "502 Bad Gateway" which seemed to be the problem over my shoulder the majority of the time.  Integrating Minio was another challenge, particularly ensuring that the FastAPI app could interact with Minio across containers. Misconfigured environment variables caused initial failures.  Setting up the CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment also presented difficulties. Ensuring all secrets were properly configured and debugging pipeline failures took multiple iterations. Breaking the pipeline into smaller steps and testing incrementally was key to resolving these issues.  The new feature implemented was profile picture management using Minio. This feature allows users to upload and manage their profile pictures, which are stored securely in Minio buckets. The feature was integrated with FastAPI using the boto3 library, and environment variables were used to configure the Minio service to allow users to personalize their accounts with profile pictures stored in a scalable object storage system.

I would say the project was rewarding in the sense that I used the interent and videos and even previous assignments to try and understand what I was doing wrong and how to make it right.  This project along with the course has been my greatest challenge but I think I can still say I did give it my best effort and used as many resources as I could.
